Yes, DB can be mocked when testing the Service layer with the JUnit test case. 

There are two ways of mocking a DB

1. mocking the java.sql package
2. mocking service/DAO class

Mocking java.sql class

@InjectMocks private DBConnection dbConnection; //annotated DB connection class
  @Mock private Connection mockConnection;  
  @Mock private Statement mockStatement;

The Connection and Statement classes of java.sql are annotated with @Mock. In the setUp method we will initialize the mock object with initMocks() method. 

Test case

Mockito.when(mockConnection.createStatement().executeUpdate(Mockito.any())).thenReturn(1); //when and then method used to test the mocked DB objects.


Mocking Service/DAO class

@Mock private MyDao myDao; //DOA object is mocked;

Mockito.when(myDao.method().thenReturn(returnMethod());
